    <div class="column">
      <p>We the Group 5, we want to advocate this Anti-Hazing law because most of the army/military now a days are died because of hazing. And now we would like to advocate this because we want to stop this kind of hazing. Many of teenager now are having fraternities just because they want to become famous but they not know that this kind of frat is the one who kill their life. We are trying to convince other people to stop this kind of hazing. NO TO FRAT YES TO HAPPY LIFE!</p>
