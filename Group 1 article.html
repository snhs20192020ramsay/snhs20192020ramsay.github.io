      <p>Same-sex marriage (also known as gay marriage) is the marriage of two people of the same sex or gender, entered into in a civil or religious ceremony. There are records of same-sex marriage dating back to the first century though there is no legal provision in Roman Law, and it was banned in the Roman Empire in the fourth. In the modern era, same-sex marriage started being legalized at the beginning of the 21st century. Today, it is available in 28 countries. </p>

      <p>Same-sex marriage is  legally performed and recognized (nationwide or in some jurisdictions) in  Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark,  Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico,  the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden,  Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay. Same-sex marriage  is also due to become legal in Costa Rica. Israel recognizes same-sex marriages  entered into abroad as full marriages. A ministerial decision decreed that  Armenia shall as well, though as of February 2019, there had been no actual  cases on 25 July 2019, the Supreme Administrative Court in Bulgaria ruled the  country must recognize a same-sex couples overseas marriage. Furthermore, the  Inter-American Court of Human Rights has issued a ruling that is expected to  facilitate recognition in several countries in the Americas.</p>
      <p>The introduction of same-sex marriage (also called marriage equality) has varied by jurisdiction, and came about through legislative change to marriage law, court rulings based on constitutional guarantees of equality, recognition that it is allowed by existing marriage law, or by direct popular vote (via referendums and initiatives). The recognition of same-sex marriage is considered to be a human right and a civil right as well as a political, social, and religious issue. The most prominent supporters of same-sex marriage are human rights and civil rights organizations as well as the medical and scientific communities, while the most prominent opponents are religious fundamentalist groups. Polls consistently show continually rising support for the recognition of same-sex marriage in all developed democracies and in some developing democracies. List of Advantages of Same-Sex Marriage (Gay Marriage) 1. Legal Rights Protection One of the most useful advantages of legalizing marriage is the protection it gives the couple when it comes to health care, finances and taxes. Before, two people who are cohabitating and in a homosexual relationship living as couples are not given the security of protecting what both have them earned and saved together. If a partner dies, the surviving lover does not have the right to the property under the name of the deceased even if both of them have paid for the property. With the legalization of gay marriage, they are now considered by the state they live in as legally married so they now can enjoy tax breaks given to heterosexual married couples and are entitled to become heirs to their spouses. This also includes signing documents together as a couple and open joint accounts and purchase properties together. 2. Lessens Stigma Legalizing gay marriage also mitigated the discrimination and stigma on homosexuals because making the union or marriage legal gives gay couples the affirmation that they are accepted not only by society but also the state. For so many years, there have been stories about discrimination of homosexuals as well as crime committed against them. Today, no one can be ostracized and discriminated in the workplace or be denied from marrying his or her partner because of sexual orientation. 3. Gives Right to Start a Family There have been lesbian and gay couples who want to start a family and have their own children. Before, this was not allowed and looked at negatively by society. If ever one partner already has children, the other partner does not have the right to be an adoptive parent or if ever, they process does not work on their favor and takes years to be completed. With the legalization, gay couples can now adopt children just as straight couples can. They can even have children of their own through in vitro fertilization or by getting surrogate mothers or sperm donors. 4. Gives Equal Laws Homosexual relationships are also the same with heterosexual relationships when it comes to the mistakes or abuses that can happen between two people. However, unlike straight married couples who can file for adultery, divorce and infidelity, gay couples were not given the same purview of the law before. With gay marriage, married homosexuals can now file for divorce and sue their partners with adultery or infidelity. Also, in case of divorce, the other one can receive alimony and their children will be given child support. We want to advocate same-sex marriage because we want to be fair to others. Everyone’s deserve happiness. Love is blind. Love is everywhere. We need to respect everyone’s decision in their life. Everyone’s deserve to love, and to be loved. </p>
