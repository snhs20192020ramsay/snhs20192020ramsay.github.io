      <p> Di man sila perpektong kaibigan pero perpekto naman ang araw mo pag kasama mo sila. Even the worst day of your life will become pefect when you’re with your friends. They may not solve the problem you’re encountering but they’ll definitely lessen your burdens. Because real friends knows when you’re down to something. Hindi man sila perpekto, pero pagdating sa pagdamay, sila yung pinaka perpektong taong makikilala mo. </p>

This global problem requires a global response and I am so excited to the growing list of countries where there is resistance and activism taking place to make public places safer for women and girls.</p>

      <h4>FLEXZY MEI R. CASTILLO</h4>
      <p class="tag">Member</p>
      <p class="text_column">I am Flexzy Mei Castillo, 17 years of age and a resident of Brgy. 23 San Andress, Sarrat Ilocos Norte. Try and try until you succeed is my motto in life wherein I apply to our advocacy. As a woman, it hurts me so much seeing my co woman being harassed and they don’t have to do but to fight it silently. Through our campaign, we hope that sexual harassment will be recognized as a problem, discussed in media and men will be held responsible for their disrespectful behaviour.</p>
