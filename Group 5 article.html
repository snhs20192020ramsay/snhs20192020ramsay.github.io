      <p><strong>NON-VIOLENCE ADVOCACY</strong></p>
      <p><strong>PHILIPPINES FRATERNITIES AND SORORITIES ADVOCACY FOR NON-VIOLENCE </strong></p>
      <p><em>The Advocacy aims to promote R.A 8049 also known as the Anti-Hazing Law through education and value formation among our youth. It will also lay down non-violent programs as possible alternatives to the traditional violent practices in accepting potential members into the brotherhood and sisterhood of Philippine fraternities and sororities. The Advocacy shall not monitor, intervene, nor regulate the organizational structure, processes, and idiosyncrasies of any fraternity and/or sorority but rather educate, re-educate any member who are interested in the non-violence programs of the advocacy. </em></p>
      <p><strong>DECLARATION OF ADHERENCE TO THE NO HAZING PRINCIPLE</strong><br>
      </p>
      <p><em>Whereas affirms the Sanctity of Human Life, Human Dignity, and the inalienable rights of every human being as the guiding principle to uplift the life of an individual, Whereas destruction of life, systematic imposition of suffering, affliction, and discomfort in the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual aspect of an individual transgress the rights of man to life and liberty, Whereas Greek-letter fraternities adhere to the highest standard of ideals and discipline in promoting its principles and objectives to the betterment of an individual and his community, Whereas it is fundamental to espouse for the development of the individual member as he will extend to the community fraternal relations and communal interest in promoting development and peace and order in Philippine society, Whereas the signatory fraternities adhere to the advocacy of a 10-year program of a decade of non-violence and promote this end through education, re-education, and projects and programs which will enhance individual and communal development and promote inter fraternity relations for the greater good of Philippine society, Whereas this declaration is a manifestation of support to the Anti-Hazing Law, and in compliance to the laws of the Republic of the Philippines. Fraternities and Sororities are continuously being invited to sign the National Declaration/Pact and to participate on existing non-violence advocacy programs… The Anti-Hazing Law penalizes members of organizations only if an applicant suffers any physical injury or dies. MANILA, Philippines – The effectiveness of the Anti-Hazing Law is once again being questioned as violent initiation rites by a fraternity claimed another life of a young law student. University of Santo Tomas student Horatio Castillo III died on September 17 due to traumatic injuries he sustained allegedly at the hands of members of the Aegis Juris fraternity. It is clear for the parents of the 22-year-old that their son “was killed by criminals” from the fraternity, expressing outrage that “barbaric and criminal acts continue to be performed in the false name of brotherhood.” These violent acts were supposed to be prevented by the Anti-Hazing Law. But many believe that the law lacks the needed teeth to actually end the long-standing “tradition” of violence present among organizations – particularly fraternities and sororities. </em></p>
      <p><strong>What does the law say? </strong></p>
      <p><em>In 1991, Ateneo law student Leonardo “Lenny” Villa died after suffering multiple injuries from hazing rites conducted by the Aquilia Legis fraternity. His death shed light on the practice and led to the enactment of the Anti-Hazing Law in 1995. But Republic Act No. 8049 still does not really prevent hazing from taking place. The law defines hazing as “an initiation rite or practice as a prerequisite for admission into membership in a fraternity, sorority or organization by placing the recruit, neophyte or applicant in some embarrassing or humiliating situations such as forcing him to do menial, silly, foolish and other similar tasks or activities or otherwise subjecting him to physical or psychological suffering or injury.” According to the law, these initiation rites can still push through if: • There is written notice addressed to the school authorities or head of organization 7 days prior • There are at least two representatives from the school present The written notice should include details about the activity, including how long it will last, the names of those who will undergo the initiation rites, and an "undertaking that no physical violence will be employed." The representatives assigned by the school, meanwhile, have the duty to “see to it that no physical harm of any kind shall be inflicted upon a recruit, neophyte or applicant.” </em></p>
      <p><strong>Hazing automatically a criminal offense </strong></p>
      <p><em>Unfortunately, the rules set forth by the law are not always followed. Various organizations across the Philippines still employ the “age-old tradition” of using violence to “test” applicants and has become an open secret among students. We need to prevent the anti-hazing law in our country by implementing the law and we need to appeal to the court. Our mission is to empower people or everyone to prevent hazing. Prohibition on Hazing. - All forms of hazing shall be prohibited in fraternities, sororities, and organizations in schools, including citizens' military training and citizens' army training. This prohibition shall likewise apply to all other fraternities, sororities, and organizations that are not school-based, such as community-based and other similar fraternities, sororities and organizations. </em></p>
      <p><strong>Ways to Stop Hazing </strong></p>
      <p><em>Even a single member has the opportunity to create an atmosphere that eliminates hazing. Here are some strategies to consider when trying to enact change within an organization. </em></p>
      <p><strong>1. Reduce the Power Differential between Members and Initiates </strong></p>
      <p><em>Members of fraternities and sororities do not have an innate desire to haze, but they are often placed in situations where they can exert power over new members. By creating an atmosphere where new members can discuss their experiences with existing members without punishment, members will find fewer opportunities to haze. </em></p>
      <p><strong>2. Give Members Time to Reflect on Their Actions </strong></p>
      <p><em>Members in a high-pressure hazing situation are more likely to think irrationally and act in demeaning ways. Planning pledging activities in advance and allowing members to understand and discuss their role in the proceedings reduces the possibility of making poor, hasty decisions. </em></p>
      <p><strong>3. Encourage Members to Voice Concern with the New Member Education Program </strong></p>
      <p><em>Those who oppose hazing are less likely to speak out if they feel they are alone in their opinion. Even a single member who speaks out against hazing can encourage others to do the same. </em></p>
      <p><strong>4. Be Willing to Amend Traditions The same education methods may not work for every new member class. </strong></p>
      <p><em>Organizations should consider multiple solutions to solving problems and use campus and organizational resources to enhance their creativity. Consider the activities you create as part of a new tradition for future members.</em></p>
      <p><em><strong>5. Develop a Chapter Anti-Hazing Policy</strong></em></p>
      <p><em> In additional to University of Rochester and your national organizational regulations, create and distribute an anti-hazing policy for your chapter. Provide an outline of non-acceptable activities and behaviors, and create internal sanctions for members who violate the policy. </em></p>
      <p><strong>6. Share Ideas with Other Organizations </strong></p>
      <p><em>Talk with members of other organizations to discuss hazing-related incidents and strategies to reduce hazing. Connect with other chapters of your organization to see how they educate new members in accordance with national policy. </em></p>
      <p><em><strong>7. Take Advantage of Campus Resources </strong></em></p>
      <p><em>The University of Rochester provides resources to foster leadership development on campus. The Rochester Center for Community Leadership (RCCL) hosts student leadership workshops that can be incorporated into the new member education program. In addition, Fraternity and Sorority Affairs is available to discuss strategies for change and ways to improve the new member program. </em></p>
