      <p><strong>Cat calling is make a whistle, shout, or comment of a sexual nature to a woman passing by.</strong></p>
      <p><em>Street harassment is a form of harassment, primarily sexual harassment that consists of unwanted comments, gestures, honking, wolf-whistlings, catcalling, exposure, following, persistent sexual advances, and touching by strangers in public areas such as streets, shopping malls, and public transportation. Women, girls and members of the LGBT+ in the Philippines continue to face the terrifying experience of being catcalled on the streets and other public spaces. This can make the experience, for both the locals and tourists, not fun! Fortunately, in the recent years, there is a growing recognition of the issue of gender-based harassment most apparent in catcalling. This can be attributed to a number of factors such as the rise of the LGBT+ movement and the availability of awareness promotion instruments such as the social media. </em></p>
      <p><strong>the act of shouting harassing and often sexually suggestive, threatening, or derisive comments at someone publicly </strong></p>

      <p>Though I seldom witness catcalling or verbal harassment, I've come to understand how constant and burdensome it can be for women, especially when the words used are crude, violent, or degrading. — Conor Friedersdorf </p>

      <p><em>Paula Bianca Tobias Bautista wrote that the woman took the side of a man who disrespected her at a street food place in Quezon City. Bautista recounted that when she was eating fast food, a stranger passed by and cat-called her for what she was wearing. She was wearing gym clothes at that time based on the photos she attached. When she confronted him, the man dismissed her as crazy and then walked away. But things did not end there. Before the man left, a woman suddenly told off Bautista that her provocative clothing was to blame for the harassment. It was then when the brawl started. “It’s bad enough that us women take shit from misogynistic men. But it’s a thousand times worse when fellow women take their side. I snapped. From that point on, everything was a blur. My vision just darkened, I got furious,” Bautista said on April 4. “We were yelling at each other, she was yelling so close to my face that I can see and feel her spit. I pulled her by the collar then slapped her. Yes, I admit, I remember I slapped her first out of pure outrage. Then she head butt[ed] me. The fight ensued,” she added. Despite sustaining several bruises after, Bautista assured in the post that she was physically fine. She admitted that she lost her cool, but she did not regret calling out against such rude behavior. “I never said I’m better than them nor do I think violence is a solution, but I don’t like staying quiet. Because silence is tolerance and tolerating immature bad behavior is what’s keeping our country in the dark ages,” she said. Any form of street-level harassment is prohibited in Quezon City by virtue of the city’s Anti-Catcalling Ordinance in 2018. These include acts such as cat-calling, cursing, taunting and stalking, all of which are punishable by penalties that range from P1,000 to P5,000 or a month in jail. Amidst all the noise in the surrounding of a busy city, women are subject to catcalls, wolfwhistles, and all other forms of behaviour which are considered as street harassment. Street harassment consists of unwanted comments, whirling-whistles, catcalling, and other actions by strangers in public areas that can be unnerving and discomforting. Simply put, street harassment promotes fear, and gives women yet another reason to be on edge when out and about. The women felt more conscious and ashamed about their body and body parts that led to self-objectification on woman because as they experienced this they felt anxious about how their body was evaluated by the strangers. As a result, objectification affected the women’s cognitive or mental state. On the other hand, this kind of public or street harassment was associated with body image, avoidance; behavior and more importantly self-esteem which have emotional effects on woman who experienced catcalling. Self-esteem is a woman’s overall evaluation her self-worth. </em></p>
      <p><strong>Street Harassment is a Major Issue on Women </strong></p>
      <p><em>Street harassment is a widespread and frustrating problem for American urban women in the pre-suffrage era as described by one researcher (Johnson, 2011). As a means of preventing harassment as early as 1909, The Women’s Municipal League in New York City promoted the women only subway cars (Kearl 2011; Schultz and Gilbert 1996). In other countries such as Japan, they had women-only transit cars since 1912 (Krieger 2012); at the present time, 15 countries offer women-only options on public transportation (Jones, 2011). A brief movement was held to outlaw flirting or the practice of "auto-invitation" in the 1920 (Coe, 2013). Therefore street harassment has been made clear from these accounts that it is not a problem unique to the modern era. Playing a central role in the battle against street harassment are the internet and other technologies. Whereas CNN reported "verbal harassment, groping, stalking and indecent exposure are a common problem for women in Egypt. HarassMap as an innovative tool, uses online and offline technology to invite women to speak out, share stories and stand up to harassers” (Lee and Kermeliotis, 2012). Dissimilarity between Catcalling and Street Harassment The major difference between catcalling and street harassment is that catcalling, contains no requirement of physical danger because the catcaller may be across the street, on the other side of a fence, in a car, or on the second story of a building, with no real access to the target. On the other hand, unlike catcalling, street harassment often involves a sense of physical danger because the harasser could be walking closely behind the target, in front of the target obstructing her path, or invading her personal space (Jefferson, 2011). According to Flores, N. M. (May 2014), street harassment encompasses incidents occurring in public, meaning public spaces like streets, sidewalks and parks, as well as modes of public transportation. Street harassment involves unwelcome words and actions by unknown persons in public places which are motivated by gender. Add to this, street harassment also includes invading a person’s physical and emotional space in a disrespectful, creepy, startling, scary, or insulting way. That’s why street harassment can be considered as a form of sexual harassment according to the nonstop profit Street Harassment. Collective Action for Safe Spaces reported that “Public sexual harassment occurs on a continuum starting with words, stalking and unwanted touching, which can lead to more aggressive crimes like rape, assault and murder” Newcomer, L. (2013), stated that men are much 12 more likely to be harassers than women, and adult women are the most common targets, followed by LGBTQ individuals. Harassment can be used as an instrument to intimidate people, to make people leave and give up, that is according to Stop Street Harassment (SSH) organization. Some men harass women to try to keep women from advancing, to prevent their equality, and to try to compel them to retreat to their homes, while as women strive to increase equal rights worldwide. (2015) A man feels he has the right to express himself to a woman, while the latter is obligated to listen to his comments and take them without insult-----because catcalling can be considered as a product of male entitlement. Male entitlement transcends class divisions like whether or not you are wealthy enough to have a nice car, or receive an education from our country’s top schools. Women know how easy it is for a small compliment to become dangerous because they know that an unwanted advance will remain as unwanted advance. (Concepcion, 2015) </em></p>
      <p>Impact of Street Harassment on Women Rather than, how street harassment might affect a women by the situation personally as individuals, still women experienced emotions and motivations in order with how the situation may help or harm them as a whole. Women experiences direct negative consequences as targets of prejudice and, as the current work demonstrates, unintended consequences as bystanders. Male perpetrators impact how women view and react to men more generally; a single man's prejudiced actions are attributed to his gender identity. (Chaudior&amp;Quinn,2010). </p>
      <p>Street harassment is needs to be taken seriously because street harassment based on Ditchthelabel.org, can be considered as part of the everyday reality for women 13 all over the world. Catcalling unreasonably affects women and it can have significant effects on their mental health/condition, self-esteem and their sense of protection as well as feeding into a culture of normalized sexism where a ‘harmless’ jeer opens up a gateway to violence, sexual aggression and systematic oppression (2015). </p>
      <p>Elevated fears of rape are a result of street harassment found by other researches. As per Newcomer, The increase in depression, the restricting of social interactions and even the impairment of cognitive function is associated in the targets of street harassment and objectification. Thus, street harassment specifically has a tendency to promote the internalization of shame. These psychological effects can have serious unintended consequence, not just on a target’s psyche, as well as in her or his everyday life: To avoid harassment, as numerous as ten percent of women report quitting a job and numerous women consider harassment (and how to avoid it) each time they go outside (2013). </p>
      <p><em>Public harassment may make women ashamed of their bodies and decrease their comfort with their sexualities in addition to making them angry, anxious, or depressed (Bowman, 1993). According to Polce-Lynch, Myers, Kliewer, and Kilmartin (2001) body image is associated to self-esteem in adolescents. Similarly, body dissatisfaction as stated by Webster and Tiggemann (2003) was related to self-concept and self-esteem, regardless of the age group and it seems reasonable to conclude that public harassment, which may affect body image, thus also affects women’s selfesteem. Therefore, there are few negative short-term and long-term effects of public harassment on women and on society as a whole. In addition to this, due to public harassment women have reported avoiding public due to fear as to showing avoidance behavior. The "Hindi ito okay (This is not okay)" tag is a digital poster created by the artist Mica Cruz pertaining to acts that make women feel unsafe, nervous and afraid. She started working on the poster after being harassed on the street for several times that day. After going viral, many reacted to her Facebook status update of the incident that lead to her realization that such acts are happening to many people every day and that those who did such acts probably are not aware of how they made women feel. Unfortunately, she found that some men actually blamed women for dressing “provocatively.” However, netizens made a strong point that harassment happened even to women who were conservatively attired. Usually, women feel that these men are pulling a prank on them or are making fun of them because some men knows how women would react and this serves as an entertainment for them (Aquino, 2014) </em></p>
